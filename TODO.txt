TODO

* unit test Run() method in CommandBase<>
	4. CommandStarting event should fire before Run()
	5. CommandEnding event should fire after Run()
	6. CommandEnding event should fire even if Run() throws exception
	
* unit test DatabaseCommandBase
	1. GetDatabaseVersion() (can use one of the VersionCommand tests almost exactly for this)

* make the build script assign a version (including GIT repo version) to the AssemblyInfo.cs files

* tag the git repo with each release (and push tag to github)

* add tests for ConnectionsCommand

* refactor ConnectionsCommand - we are doing some custom argument validation here that should use the same
	routines as the command argument validation.
	
* refactor the ConnectionsCommandArgsActionValidator attribute into a more generic, OptionSetValidatorAttribute that takes
	a list of valid values for the property

CONFIRM FIXED
* CreateBlankScript() outputs a template with too many empty lines in it
