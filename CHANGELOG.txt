= 0.7 / IN PROGRESS

	This release brings yet another significant rewrite. Building
	on the MEF integration and innovations of 0.6, many improvements
	have been made to make writing commands easier and safer.
	
	* New strongly-typed parsing of command line arguments with
	  support DataAnnotation attributes for validation and
	  automatic integration with the help system.
	  
	* Revamped help system that provides detailed info on the
	  usage of all commands, including custom commands.
	
	* New CommandBase and DatabaseCommandBase classes for building
	  custom commands.
	  
	* Rewritten data access routines that wrap all bulk operations
	  in transactions. Also much smarter database connection
	  handling.
	  
	* Smarter, more robust parsing of migrations scripts that contain
	  GO keywords. Special thanks to the Subtext project who we
	  borrowed these improvements from!
	
	* New 'connections' command that provides a command line interface
	  for viewing, adding, editing and removing stored connection
	  strings in the config file.
	
	* Beefed up unit tests suite with full coverage of all critical
	  routines.
	  
	* Various bug fixes.

= 0.6 / 2010-01-28

	This version has been completely rewritten from the ground up using
	.Net 3.5 and the Managed Extensibility Framework.
	
	* Completely new directory structure and codebase
	
	* MEF has been used to assist in the inner workings of the application
	  as well as allow for new logs and commands to be created.
	
	* Unit Tests Project has been added - tests use the NUnit framework
	
	* An automated build file has been created for NAnt v0.86 b1
	
	* Core project has been created to allow for easy access to classes
	  required for extending DotNetMigrations
	
	* BREAKING CHANGE: BulkCopy Command has been removed.
	  The BulkCopy command has temporarily been removed from the bundled
	  commands of the application. This command will be moved to the
	  DotNetMigrations-Contrib project as soon as it's ready. If you use
	  the bulkcopy command, please continue using v0.5.
	  
	== Notes about the DotNetMigrations-Contrib Project
	Thanks to the Managed Extensibility Framework, DotNetMigrations is
	now able to have new commands and logging mechanisms to be created
	and added by anyone who wants. Because of this, the
	DotNetMigrations-Contrib project is being launched in the very near
	future (target launch date is Feb 01, 2010). The goal of this sister
	project is to provide a location for people to share new commands
	and logs to the application without having to worry about getting a
	different version of the core DotNetMigrations application from
	this project.
